## 🌟 Cool Tricks

Here’s how you can add extra colour:
- Use SVG text for vibrant sections:[1]

```html
<svg width="200" height="40">
  <text x="10" y="30" fill="#fbbc05" font-size="24">Leetcode Magic!</text>
</svg>
```

- Add emojis for fun (e.g. 🚀, 🧠, 🥇).
- Insert shields.io badges for status, language, and fun metrics.
- Use playful headlines and quotes.
